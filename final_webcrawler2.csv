"Scripture References: 
1. The quote ""to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield"" is from the poem ""Ulysses"" by Lord Alfred Tennyson.
2. The mention of ""memorizing our most important ideas"" likely refers to passages in Deuteronomy and Psalms in the Bible that encourage memorizing and reflecting on the words and teachings of God.
3. The reference to ""things are in the saddle, and ride mankind"" is a paraphrase of a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson.
4. The mention of the printed word and the end of memorizing ideas could be alluding to how the spread of written text and the printing press changed the way information was communicated and preserved. This concept of change and adaptation can be found throughout the Bible in various stories and parables.
5. The reference to technology, comfort, convenience, and pleasure leading to manipulation and control alludes to various passages in the Bible warning against the love of material things and the dangers of idolatry.
6. The mention of ""hyperconnected discipleship"" and reliance on technology to manage patients remotely could be seen as a reflection of a lack of personal connection and care, which can be contrasted with various passages in the Bible that stress the importance of compassion, empathy, and personal relationships.
7. The emphasis on the absence of presence and the need for focused attention on those around us aligns with teachings in the Bible about the value of being fully present in the moment and engaging meaningfully with others."

Another reference to scriptures is seen in Whitney's interaction with the Savior, where Whitney asks to go with him but is told, ""No, my son; these have finished their work, and they may go with me, but you must stay and finish yours.""

"The analysis of James Covel's life and work as a Methodist minister provides insight into the broader context of religious debates in early 19th-century America. The revelations directed to him by Joseph Smith highlight the differences between Methodism and Mormonism, especially regarding baptism, missionary work, and church authority. Covel's decision not to join Mormonism sheds light on the challenges and complexities of religious conversion and the firm commitment of Methodists to their beliefs.

The letters and records of Covel's interactions with Mormonism and his return to active preaching as a Methodist show his dedication to his faith and his resistance to doctrinal changes. Despite the allure of Mormonism and the promises of a greater mission, Covel remained steadfast in his Methodist beliefs and practices. His legacy as a preacher and reformer within Methodism is a testament to his lifelong commitment to the church and its teachings.

The story of James Covel provides a unique perspective on the religious landscape of the time and sheds light on the personal struggles and decisions faced by individuals caught between different faith traditions. Through his experiences, we can gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and choices that shaped the religious identity of early American Christians. His refusal to join Mormonism despite the revelations directed to him serves as a reminder of the complexities of religious conversion and the enduring commitment to one's faith."

Other references to biblical themes and figures, such as Moses, the creation story from Genesis, and various passages from the New Testament, are also present.

In this text, the focus is on the depiction of the Ezekiel cycle in the Dura Europos synagogue, with references to themes of resurrection, heavenly ascent, and ritual practices. The author draws parallels between the art in the synagogue and ancient Jewish mystical traditions, particularly those influenced by the writings of Philo. The discussion also touches on the significance of temple themes in Judaism, the role of initiation rites in mystical traditions, and the symbolic meanings attached to various elements in the artwork.

"Brigham Young University has had a complex history shaped by the leadership and vision of its early administrators. Karl G. Maeser, the first principal, laid a strong foundation for the institution as he guided it through its formative years. His emphasis on the integration of secular knowledge with spiritual principles set the tone for the university's educational philosophy. Maeser's successors, including Benjamin Cluff, continued to build on this legacy.

Benjamin Cluff played a significant role in transforming Brigham Young Academy into a full-fledged university. His leadership saw the establishment of collegiate programs, expansion of the curriculum, and the awarding of bachelor's degrees. Cluff's vision for the university encompassed both academic excellence and a commitment to the principles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

While Cluff faced challenges and controversies during his tenure, including a quest to find Book of Mormon lands and a tumultuous expedition to Latin America, his dedication to advancing the university's mission never wavered. Despite his later struggles and setbacks, Cluff's contributions to BYU's growth and development were lasting and significant.

Through his efforts, Cluff left a lasting legacy at Brigham Young University, shaping its academic programs, faculty composition, and institutional identity. His commitment to integrating religious values with secular education paved the way for the university's future success and growth. Cluff's role in guiding BYU through a period of transition and expansion cannot be understated, and his impact on the institution is a testament to his dedication and vision."

"1 David White Rogers—like Nephi—responded to the calls of his Church leaders with faith and courage when others even flinched from fear. Baptized when he was fifty, Rogers devoted his remaining forty-four years to building the kingdom of God.

After their sermon, the elders—Parley P. Pratt and Elijah Fordham—informed the congregation that there would be no more meetings, as few showed interest in their message. When David heard this announcement, he stood up and invited the elders to his home. He stated that the men were speaking the truth, and he thought there were others in the city who would like to hear the elders’ message. Rogers’s offer helped fulfill the elders’ earlier impression that people would be raised up to aid them in the work there.

In the dream, David was “taken by a guide to a point where he was shown a terrible, swift destruction which seemed to embrace the whole face of the land. He was told by his guide that he would learn more about the terrible event when he was fifty years of age.”

At the Church’s October conference, he reported briefly on his mission."

"The text contains references to Scripture in the following sections:
- ""But it doesn’t really matter—either the fact that Twain misunderstood Mormon life or the “Mormon Bible”—for Twain was, above all, a humorist and therefore dependent upon the immediate response of his generally American audience, an audience which had preformed and thus very exploitable judgments about the Mormons and their “peculiar institutions.” He knew that irreverence, or at least a humor which, says Pascal Covici, presents “a solemn association in a context that is ridiculous and insignficant,” is a dependable device for setting up that necessary and fruitful tension which Henry Nash Smith has called “two ways of viewing the world,” the tension between the “genteel and the vernacular.""
- ""Mark Twain’s humorous treatment not only of the Book of Mormon, but other sacred writings as well. Twain reveled in treating the solemn, immutable splendor of the sacred books of the Western and Eastern worlds with a flippant and, for some, shocking earthiness.""
- ""As a youth he was, like Huck and Tom, thoroughly exposed to the Calvinistic interpretation of the Bible, a pious milieu, and devout friends—all of which vigorously cooperated to make young Sam Clemens familiar with God’s Word.""

These are examples of where scripture is mentioned in the text, providing context for how Mark Twain's humor and irreverence were applied to sacred writings."

2. His imperialistic political program for Russia was founded on questionable religious considerations.
3. “The separation” or “segregation” of what has come to be known as the “superfluous man” from his foundations, his rootlessness, was seen by Dostoevsky as the direct result of the efforts of Peter the Great to introduce into Russia European ideas, technology, and institutions.
4. The first signs of the growth of the revolutionary bacillus are found in the many cases of Russian intellectuals who began playing at “liberalism,” and at a somewhat later date with socialism.
5. His novels are sometimes dominated by these themes. His famous novel Crime and Punishment is an example of an entire work of art developed on the theme of human guilt.
6. Dostoevsky wrote an entire book attacking materialistic, utilitarian ethics. The Notes from the Underground not only offers a violent objection to the factual validity of the assumed “rationality” of the assumed “rationality” of man, but the Notes present a systematic defense of the “irrational,” and the “free” aspects of human existence.
7. Dostoevsky believed that society had produced the potential for Nechaievtzi as it had segregated its “Russian boys.”
